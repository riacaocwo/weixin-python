Pati Patni Aur Tawaif was a moderate success at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics. Some praised the performances of the lead actors and the music, while others criticized the plot and the direction. The film was also compared unfavorably to its original version, Bazar-e-Husn, which was considered more realistic and nuanced. However, the film has gained a cult following among fans of Mithun Chakraborty and Salma Agha, who shared a sizzling chemistry on screen.
  
The film explores the themes of love, loyalty, betrayal and morality in the context of Indian society and culture. The film also raises questions about the status and dignity of women who are forced into prostitution by circumstances. The film shows the contrast between the glamorous world of cinema and the harsh reality of the red-light area. The film also depicts the hypocrisy and double standards of some men who exploit women for their own pleasure and then discard them.
 
The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike. Some praised the film for its bold and realistic portrayal of the issues faced by prostitutes and their clients. Some also appreciated the acting skills of Mithun Chakraborty and Salma Agha, who delivered convincing performances as the conflicted lovers. Some also lauded the music of LaxmikantâPyarelal, which added to the emotional appeal of the film.
 
However, some criticized the film for its weak and predictable plot, which relied on clichÃ©s and melodrama. Some also felt that the film was too long and dragged in some parts. Some also found the film to be morally ambiguous and insensitive to the plight of women. Some also compared the film unfavorably to its original version, Bazar-e-Husn, which was more subtle and nuanced in its treatment of the subject matter.
 
Pati Patni Aur Tawaif is a film that can be enjoyed by fans of Bollywood drama and music, but may not appeal to everyone's taste and sensibility. The film is a reflection of its time and culture, and may not be relevant or relatable to modern audiences. The film is a classic example of how Bollywood remakes can sometimes lose the essence and charm of their original sources.
