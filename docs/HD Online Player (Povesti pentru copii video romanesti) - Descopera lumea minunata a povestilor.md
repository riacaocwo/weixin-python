It has a text-based user interface that guides users through the recovery process using data carving techniques, which search for file headers and footers to identify and restore files. PhotoRec can recover the files with more than 480 file extensions (about 300 file families), including common formats such as JPEG, MP3, PDF, ZIP and more.[1] Users can also add custom file signature to detect less known or proprietary files that are not supported by default.[2]
  
PhotoRec works with different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and more. It can also run on devices that have limited resources, such as routers or old computers. PhotoRec does not require installation and can be run from a USB drive or a CD-ROM. PhotoRec is compatible with many file systems, such as FAT, NTFS, ext2/ext3/ext4 and more. It can also recover files from encrypted or compressed partitions.

TestDisk can also fix boot sectors, rebuild file systems and recover lost files from deleted partitions.
